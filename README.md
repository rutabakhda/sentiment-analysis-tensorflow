Sentiment analysis using TensorFlow 2.0

This repository contains the iPython notebook and training data for sentiment analysis with bidirectional LSTM. There is also another file called pre-trained-sentiment-analysis.ipynb which allows you to input your own text and see the output of the trained network.

Before running the notebook, you first need to download all the data. As always, the first step is to clone this repository.
